# Fantasy Football Analytics

This project was used as my "First Personal Project" for the Boot.dev coursework

## Goal/Inspiration

For years I have participated in a dynasty fantasy football leauge where each team keeps all thier players from year to year.
This type of leauge poses many challenged beyond a standard leauge due to the need to account not only for the current season but future seasons as well.
I believe a stronger understanding of the underlying data for each player and team can provide siginificant upside in player acquistion, trades, and team management.
This project attempts to highligh key insights from the data in a streamlined manner.
